## Algorithms

Algorithms are a set of instructions or rules defined to solve a particular problem. Understanding algorithms will help you solve problems more efficiently and effectively. Some common algorithms include sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and searching algorithms like Binary Search.

## Binary Search
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding a 
target value within a sorted array.
It has a time complexity of O(log n), 
making it much more efficient than linear search (O(n)) 
in a sorted array.
